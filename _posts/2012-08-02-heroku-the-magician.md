title: Heroku the Magician!
---

In an earlier blog post entitled [Heroku's uptime numbers are off](/2012/07/27/testing-in-isolation-example-with-rabl.html),
Heroku claimed their uptime was 99.28% and I calculated it closer to 96.25%.

Status page a few days ago:
![Heroku Status in July](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X2S412f1w2t3D0M1810/Heroku%20Status.png)

Now, they're combining multiple months together to decrease the number.

Status page today:
![Heroku new Status for June](http://f.cl.ly/items/3M0Y1B3S352z091l2f1k/Heroku%20New%20June.png)

The numbers are looking better and better eh?

Three questions:

1. Why are they listing July separate (which was a good month right?)
   and then the 3 previous months with July included again?
2. What happened to January through April?
3. Is this going to be a rolling previous three months? Or is next month
   going to drop May and June then list only July and August?

I wish their marketing department didn't make these pages.

They should list percentages for the current month and the previous
month with a link to a page listing all the months ever recorded.

Even better would be to mimic your [parent company (Salesforce)](http://status.salesforce.com/trust/status/)
or [Amazon](http://status.aws.amazon.com/). The way they list history is
much easier to digest.

Amazon:
