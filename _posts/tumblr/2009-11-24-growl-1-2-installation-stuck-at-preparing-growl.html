title: Growl 1.2 installation stuck at Preparing Growl
---

<p>Turns out if you have the iPhone Simulator running when upgrading <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>, it will get stuck while Preparing Growl for installation.  The hangup occurs as the installation process starts after the Package Installer has taken in your input and authenticates your Admin rights.</p>

<p>Looks as though the iPhone Simulator conflicts with any Package Installer over at <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/7214991">Open Radar</a>.</p>

<p>Apple tries too hard to keep their iPhone OS under lockdown under SDK conditions knowing that jailbroken phones exist.  They should open it up.  What&#8217;s the concern?</p>
