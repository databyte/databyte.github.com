title: Technology 10+ years ago

<p>I’m moving out of a house that I’ve spent almost 10 years in, with boxes from before then.  This time, I’m being a little pickier with what I bring since it’s NYC and space is at a premium.</p>

<p>While going over boxes of “junk”, I’ve noticed:</p>

<ul><li>JavaScript hasn’t come too far from the basics back in 2000.</li>

<li>I’m glad I don’t have to program in COM or, worse, DCOM anymore.</li>

<li>PGP never really took off like I thought it would.</li>

<li>I miss OS/2.</li>

<li>I sure did have a lot of dial-up and telnet hosts written down.</li>

<li>PixiNet was my first real ISP in Hawaii after local dial-up modem banks and MILNET (part of the old DDN).</li>

<li>Apparently over Christmas break during ‘99, I printed out a list of all known ports (119 pages) and started figuring out what each was for and known vunerabilities of each.</li>

<li>Man did I print a lot, good thing I have EverNote now.</li>

<li>I still miss OS/2.</li>

</ul>
