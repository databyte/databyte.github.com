title: Social Media Certification - No!
---

<p>I&#8217;m trying to process <a href="http://gilwellgroup.blogspot.com/2009/10/social-media-certification-yes-or-no.html">this article proposing the question</a>, &#8220;Is it possible to really be an expert in Social Media Marketing?&#8221; and should a certification exist for such an expert.</p>

<p>I have three simple answers:</p>

<ol><li>Your marketing personnel should already use social media to reach customers.</li>

<li>Your customer support personnel should already use social media to help your customers.</li>

<li>Your product managers should already use social media to engage your customers.</li>

</ol><p>An &#8220;expert&#8221; in social media should be measured by how you apply social media to better your product, your people, and all your other customers.  Certifications can be built into marketing degrees if necessary, but the best approach is to simply gauge a person&#8217;s past experiences and performance.  And it&#8217;s a good thing that social media experts can show off their work online.</p>

<p>So stop calling yourself a Social Media expert.  It&#8217;s Marketing with a sprinkle of social media on top.  You still need to know how to sell it, how to pull customers in, and how to improve everything along the way!</p>
