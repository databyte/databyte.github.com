title: Pwn that feature
---

<p>It&#8217;s easy to start down the path of creating a feature or just making a change until you hit a roadblock. It may have you cut a corner, half-ass your testing or otherwise do a less than awesome job.</p>

<p>I periodically work with the guys at <a href="http://gojee.com">@gojee</a> and they&#8217;re building out this new feature using CSS3 animations. Testing those CSS3 animations in Safari 5.1 look great and it works just as you would expect across Chrome and Firefox (sorry IE, you don&#8217;t get animations). However in Safari 5.0, it&#8217;s not all sunshine and rainbows.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to say &#8220;well, Safari 5.0 is only 7% of our users so let&#8217;s not worry about it so much&#8221; and degrade them to static images. However, the idea to use CSS3 instead of Flash was someone&#8217;s decision.</p>

<p>Guess whose working on making it work across as many cool browsers as possible including Safari 5.0 tonight? Yep, that person who championed the decision but also the entire team. From <a href="http://www.implementingscrum.com/2006/09/11/the-classic-story-of-the-pig-and-chicken/">chickens to pigs</a>, everyone&#8217;s helping to change and test the feature.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ll end up pwning this issue and not stop until it&#8217;s done.</p>

<p>Ask yourself:</p>

<ul><li>Would you delay your next feature until the current one&#8217;s perfect?</li>

</ul><ul><li>Would you pay extra to have the tools your team wants or needs? And not the same equipment your mom would get (unless of course she likes SSD).</li>

</ul><ul><li>Would you focus on fewer better features instead of many crappy ones?</li>

</ul><p>After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451648537/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mybl03-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1451648537">Steve Job&#8217;s biography</a> and remembering a blog post on ServerFault about <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/post/the-limits-of-cost-benefit-analysis-in-it/">The Awesome Factor</a>. The phrases &#8220;amazing or shit&#8221; and &#8220;just make it awesome&#8221; come to mind, respectively.</p>

<p>Everyone needs to own their own part. It can&#8217;t be one person  staying up late testing everything, tweaking and ultimately making it  awesome. It should be everyone owning their own change, helping out their teammate and making it awesome.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Own it - Love it - Just make it awesome!</strong></p>
