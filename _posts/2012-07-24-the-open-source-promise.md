title: The Open Source Promise
---

The [recent fuss over Sparrow](http://mattgemmell.com/2012/07/21/entitlement-and-acquisition/) 
reminds me of something a friend was doing the other day on Pinterest. 
She was copying and pasting the images out of the site into a Word
document. Mind you she hates Word. I told her she could pin it to her
own board and her response was: "Why bother? They'll just close the site
down in a couple years and I'll lose everything.  This way, I know I'll
have it."

Unfortunately this proposal doesn't work for highly trafficked sites
that require a team of dedicated engineers to keep it operating but it
would work for Sparrow and a number of other useful applications that have
disappeared.

**The Open Source Promise.**

The company promises that the **product Foo will be open sourced** should
the company be **acquired or shutdown** and **stop maintaining** the product.

The benefits to the customer are obvious. We still get to use the
software and help keep it going. The benefits to the company are
numerous as well. It helps the company brand as their product gains
popularity. It bolsters the parent company's brand as they acquire their
talent. There's little need to worry about the brand since the company
was going to kill it anyway but if lawyers are involved, it could easily
be ripped out and left for the community to rebrand it as part of the
transition plan.

I would love to see a variation of this license 
[available online](http://opensource.org/licenses/category) but we need
baby steps.

So if you're looking to quell some of our fears or shine a better light
on your new corporate overlords, put up an **Open Source Promise**.
